1. edit the ClientAliveInterval to 120 in /etc/ssh/ssh_config on ec2 to prevent time outs when building the database.
2. set ServerAliveInterval to 120 in /etc/ssh/ssh_config on your client. This applies to linux only. Figure out what adaptation you may need on windows or OSX.

3. launch the standard EC2 instance
4. 
mount -t ext4 /dev/xvdf /data

/data/start_postgres.sh
su - w205

5. make  a directory called /data/final and navigate to it
Copy the files query_blockchain.py , add_in_missing_heights.py, get_price.py and build_blockchain.sh from github to the directory.
6. create a database called blockchain and connect to it:
    psql -U postgres
    create database blockchain;
    \c blockchain
    
7. Create your tables:

CREATE TABLE blocks (
    hash_value text primary key,
    height text,
    block_tx_count text,
    timestamp timestamp 
);


CREATE TABLE price (
   date timestamp primary key,
   price text
  
);

8. exit out of postgres
9. get pip working for python 2.7 by running the following as root
wget --no-check-certificate http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/d/distribute/distribute-0.6.35.tar.gz
tar xf distribute-0.6.35.tar.gz
cd distribute-0.6.35
python2.7 setup.py install
easy_install-2.7 pip
11. run the following as root:
pip2.7 install psycopg2



10. Go to /data/final and run:
nohup bash  build_blockchain.sh > building_blockchain.txt &

and then press cntrl c to get back to the command line. type ps and you should see a python process for every year between 2009 to 2017. The process should take 
25 hours. You should also see a log file when the initial build of 2009 to 2017 is done to add in blocks that were skipped. It is called 2nd_running_database_add.txt 
You will also see a log file of the shell script process called building_blockchain.txt

11. Export your database from postgres to csv:
In terminal type:
psql -U postgres
\c blockchain
COPY price to '/data/final/price.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;
COPY blocks to '/data/final/price.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;
\q

12. MIGRATE csvs to bigquery ::FILL IN DETAILS HERE::
