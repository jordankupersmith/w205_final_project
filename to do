-Add in daily average price, and daily total BTC transacted from a large singular daily updated JSON file from blockchain.info
-consolidate query_bitcoin.py into one call to blockchain.info per block (currently separate call for each variable)
-see if this site has anything useful : https://www.quandl.com/
-add a streaming aspect that checks for a new block every 10 or so minutes. See Peter's slack chat on 23/3. 
-push the pull of the blockchain into bigquery (maybe put it in postgres as an intermediate step?)
-Do a stress test of the pull. Make sure that there is no timeout and we can pull the whole blockchain. See how long it takes
  turn off your wifi and see what happens in the case of an internet hiccup. Maybe write a code fix for it.
-Add a unique_id for each block row. Would the hash variable work?
