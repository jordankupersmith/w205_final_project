-Add in daily average price, and daily total BTC transacted from a large singular daily updated JSON file from blockchain.info
-see if this site has anything useful : https://www.quandl.com/
-add a streaming aspect that checks for a new block every 10 or so minutes. See Peter's slack chat on 23/3. 
-push the pull of the blockchain into bigquery (maybe put it in postgres as an intermediate step?)
-recast numbers expressed as string in postgres to integer (couldn't figure out how to get python to insert them into postgres as numbers)
-Do we want to reformat the initial database build to go directly into bigquery or keep it as postgres, migrate it to bigquery and then build the streaming aspect onto bigquery?
-GDELT aspect
-any way to layer in analysis of mining pools such as consolidation? Geotagging?
