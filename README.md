initial_setup_guide.txt is the original topology referred to in slide 6 of The Blockchain - Final.pptx, along with the BigQuery and Tableau components of slide 8
threaded_setup_guide.txt is the topology referred to in slide 8 of The Blockchain - Final.pptx

initial_setup_guide.txt takes 22 hours and is very stable. Threaded_setup_guide.txt takes significantly less time, but it is less stable (you might have to start over if your internet connection is unstable or bigquery is unavailable). Both versions will result in the same product, which means you can choose either to run. 

Whichever set up guide you choose to run to get to get the blockchain database built, please refer to intial_setup_guide.txt beginning on step 12 to integrate with the GDELT database.
