This guide assumes
-- you have a gcp account
-- you have a gcp project with billing enabled
-- you have enabled bigquery for your project

1 -- install google cloud sdk
https://cloud.google.com/sdk/downloads

Don't forget to run...

$ gcloud init
https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/init

$ gcloud auth login
https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth/login

$ gcloud config set project myProject
https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/config/set

2 install bigquery client libraries (click on the link below and follow instructions)
https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/libraries

3 -- create a dataset
bq mk <dataset_name>

4 -- create a table
bash ./make_table.sh <dataset_name> <table_name>

5 -- load historical data
python threaded_query_blockchain.py -s <start_date> -e <end_date> -t <table_name> -d <dataset_name> -n <num_threads>
Note: on a macbook pro with a moderate connection, we ran successfully with ~60 threads
Note: a google application credential must be set beforehand. 
See: https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/application-default-credentials
Once the credential is downloaded, you must type this in terminal:
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS='/path/to/your/client_secret.json'

6 -- dedupe historical data. Note -- it's ok for source_table and dest_table to be the same
./dedupe_table.sh <dataset_name> <source_table> <dest_table>

7 -- start streaming. Note -- table_name should be the same as dest_table above, to ensure you're streaming to the deduped table
python streaming_mode.py -t <table_name> -d <dataset_name> -s <sleep_time>
Note sleep time is in seconds. In the early days of bitcoin, you could see over 1 hour between blocks and sometimes blocks that were a few seconds apart. However, now with the network being more mature it is an average of 9 minutes with little deviation. We recommend a 1 minute sleep time to be safe.
